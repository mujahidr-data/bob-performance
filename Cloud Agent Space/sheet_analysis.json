She has taken complete responsibility for the MI (Market Intelligence) platform and demonstrated remarkable growth in her scope and accountability.\nExamples:\nWhen Anshu joined as a junior engineer, she quickly moved beyond simply completing assigned tasks to taking genuine ownership of the MI platform. Within just a few months, she progressed to independently managing the entire platform, which now handles 30 million crawls per day\u2014a scale that demands both technical excellence and operational responsibility.\nHer ownership extends beyond just keeping systems running. She has taken end-to-end accountability for multiple critical areas including FD ticket resolution, monitoring MI crawl volume trends, managing retailer additions, and maintaining customer relationships for market share data. She doesn't wait to be asked or limit herself to narrowly defined responsibilities\u2014she proactively identifies what needs to be done and takes action.\nImpact:\nPerhaps most significantly, Anshu's comprehensive ownership of MI enabled Bhadresh and Shraddha to transition out of MI responsibilities entirely, knowing the platform was in capable hands. This demonstrates the highest level of ownership\u2014taking responsibility not just for tasks, but for entire business-critical systems in a way that creates capacity and opportunities for others. She acts on behalf of the company's needs, never saying \"that's not my job,\" and thinks beyond immediate fixes to ensure long-term platform stability and success.",

However, when faced with challenges\u2014whether it's crawl volume issues, retailer addition complexities, or system performance bottlenecks\u2014there's an opportunity for her to more consistently step back and ask fundamental questions like \"What are we really trying to solve?\" and \"Is there a completely different approach we haven't considered?\" Rather than incrementally improving existing solutions, she could benefit from breaking problems down to first principles and rebuilding solutions from the ground up.",
